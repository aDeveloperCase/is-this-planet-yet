# Noise on sphere experiment

This is just an experiment I wrote to learn how to build real-time procedural planets.


## Status

State of the planet:

## Noise functions

The noise functions I'm using are not mine and they are not included in this repository.  
If you want to know more about them please have a look at [this repo](https://github.com/rust-adventure/bevy-examples/tree/main/libs/bevy_shader_utils).

## How to run
This repository is part of my local rust workspace setup, so it will not work straight away.

In order to run this code locally you will need to change the `Cargo.toml` file to match your environment.

Even if the noise functions are not included, they still need to be implemented locally in order for the code to run.
